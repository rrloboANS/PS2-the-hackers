# Problem Set 2

## Group project
This is a group project.
You should work in groups of 2 to 4 (not alone and not more than 4). If this is a problem, please let me know ahead of time.

### Please enter the names of the group members here:
1. Mireya Smith
1. Richard Lobo
1. Norman Andino
1. Eve Rowland

## Due date
**It is my hope that is can be turned in on Friday, May 22nd**, but I will take it until May 26th at the latest.

## The dataset
I have provided a dataset that you will use for this. The dataset and it's description are on the cluster as well as in github.
 * The dataset is at: `/ufrc/bsc4452/share/Class_Files/data/flights.May2017-Apr2018.csv`
 * The metadata (description of the data) is at: `/ufrc/bsc4452/share/Class_Files/data/flights_metadata.md`
     * It is also [nicely rendered on github](https://github.com/CompTools/Class_Files/blob/master/data/flights_metadata.md).

## Instructions

The goal of this project is to write a Bash script that does the following:
1. Counts the number of flights that were delayed more than 15 minutes into or out of Gainesville, FL (airport code GNV) during the timeframe covered by the dataset. (*2 points*)
2. Produce a table (text is fine) with the data to fill in this table (*13 points*):


GNV to: | Total flights | Total flights delayed (>15min) | Total flights delayed due to Weather
--------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------------
ATL |
CLT |
MIA |

3. Within a function, print a list of all unique airport codes contained in the dataset. (*3 points*)

4. Within a function list the cities in Florida that have airports in the dataset. (*2 points*)

**Bonus question:**  Asks for user input (see chapter 28) to enter either a airport code or city, state name and then calculates the number of flights as in question 1. (*5 points extra credit*)

## To submit
You should submit your answer as one or more scripts in a git repository. Submit the link in Canvas.

You should start in Canvas, creating your group and then create the same group in github.

**Be sure to edit this README.md file with the names of the group members.**
